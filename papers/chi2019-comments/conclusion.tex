\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper aims to address an under-researched issue in the field of user interaction with technology, namely, social media negative sentiment \emph{(NS)} especially \textit{Non-use}. We believe this is imperative to understand the mindset of tech-savvy non-participants and the factors that play a pivotal role in this regard. We collected user generated comments from a technology blog called Slashdot \& a security blog called Schneier on Security and through qualitative coding got significant responses related to \emph{(NS)} and \textit{Non-use}. Further analysis unveiled several user dissatisfaction related to Facebook, for example, flaws in Facebook architecture, privacy and security concerns, personal issues etc. Our findings have manifold implications for non-expert users, system designers, business analysts in designing and evaluating a reliable, fail-safe system. Besides, our work invokes several interesting questions, for example, does availability of more data enable us to perform temporal (time-series) sentiment analysis on non-participants? How do the same techniques apply to other sources of data comprised of diverse population (layman and tech-savvy)?
