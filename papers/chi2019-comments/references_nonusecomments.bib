  abstract = {Prior research has provided valuable insights into how and why employees make a decision about the adoption and use of information technologies (ITs) in the workplace. From an organizational point of view, however, the more important issue is how managers make informed decisions about interventions that can lead to greater acceptance and effective utilization of IT. There is limited research in the IT implementation literature that deals with the role of interventions to aid such managerial decision making. Particularly, there is a need to understand how various interventions can influence the known determinants of IT adoption and use. To address this gap in the literature, we draw from the vast body of research on the technology acceptance model (TAM), particularly the work on the determinants of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, and: (i) develop a comprehensive nomological network (integrated model) of the determinants of individual level (IT) adoption and use; (ii) empirically test the proposed integrated model; and (iii) present a research agenda focused on potential pre‐ and postimplementation interventions that can enhance employees' adoption and use of IT. Our findings and research agenda have important implications for managerial decision making on IT implementation in organizations.}

specifically on Facebook and those users who have left the

between use and non-use, that various practices enable
diverse ways and degrees of engagement with and
disengagement from Facebook. Furthermore, qualitative
analysis reveals numerous complex and interrelated
motivations and justifications, both for leaving and for
maintaining some type of connection. These motivations
include: privacy, data misuse, productivity, banality,
addiction, and external pressures. These results not only
contribute to our understanding of online sociality by
examining this under-explored area, but they also build on
previous work to help advance how we conceptually
account for the sociological processes of non-use.}

majority of members in online groups, yet little is known about them. Without insight into lurkers, our
understanding of online groups is incomplete. Ignoring, dismissing, or misunderstanding lurking distorts
knowledge of life online and may lead to inappropriate design of online environments.
To investigate lurking, the authors carried out a study of lurking using in-depth, semi-structured interviews
with ten members of online groups. 79 reasons for lurking and seven lurkers’ needs are identified from the
interview transcripts. The analysis reveals that lurking is a strategic activity involving more than just
reading posts. Reasons for lurking are categorized and a gratification model is proposed to explain lurker
behavior.}

This project was an out-of-class project aimed at motivating students to take advantage of authentic environments outside the classroom in order to practice language skills and communicate with others.  This study seeks to determine the usefulness of using blogs in the foreign language classroom, and to assist foreign language professionals interested in developing learner independence in their own learners by using this relatively new computer-based learning forum.  Data were collected from learners through questionnaires and interviews conducted at the end of the term.  At this time, learners were asked to reflect on their attitudes about the blog project and how it aided them in practicing English out of the classroom.  Findings suggest that learner-perceived benefits of using blogs included increased interest and motivation to use English because of interaction with, and feedback from, classmates and teachers.  There is also indication, however, that although the project helped to improve reading and writing skills, some learners were more interested in developing oral communication skills not directly addressed in the blog project.  The findings also suggest that learners who participated in the blog project were interested in continuing to blog even after the semester finished.  Further research needs to focus on whether or not learners did indeed continue using this resource after the course ended, and in which foreign language courses this project is most suitable.}

A ‘digital literacy’ exists where flexible and mobile technologies must be explored

This paper will focus on the educational possibilities of blogs, wikis and RSS feeds.
Blogs and wikis are two new content development and management technologies
that enable an interactive and intercreative engagement amongst students and
between students and teachers. RSS is a technology for syndicating information such
as the content of websites. These technologies enable desirable practices such as
collaborative content creation, peer assessment, formative evaluation of student
work, individual as well as group reflection on learning experiences, and up-to-date
information regarding changes in collaborative spaces, and can be used in the
development of authentic learning tasks. An overview of each technology will be
presented with pragmatic suggestions for their incorporation into the student

Easy to use, from any Internet connection point, blogging has become firmly established as a web based communications tool. The blogging phenomenon has evolved from its early origin as a medium for the publication of simple, online personal diaries, to the latest disruptive technology, the 'killer app' that has the capacity to engage people in collaborative activity, knowledge sharing, reflection and debate (Hiler, 2003). Many blogs have large and dedicated readerships, and blog clusters have formed linking fellow bloggers in accordance with their common interests. This paper explores the potential of blogs as learning spaces for students in the higher education sector. It refers to the nascent literature on the subject, explores methods for using blogs for educational purposes in university courses (eg. Harvard Law School), and records the experience of the Brisbane Graduate School of Business at Queensland University of Technology, with its 'MBA blog'. The paper concludes that blogging has the potential to be a transformational technology for teaching and learning.}

The analysis uses a dataset derived from a content analysis performed on blogs from three Canadian partisan blogrolls in October 2005. We perform three tests of the deliberative qualities of blog-based discussions: (a) whether discussion is characterized by equality of participation; (b) whether bloggers discuss substantive issues; and (c) whether bloggers engage constructively in discussions with political opponents. We find that this online discussion does exhibit some deliberative characteristics but that this discussion is often characterized by inequality of discussion, a focus on non-substantive issues, and unconstructive engagement between bloggers.}

Quantitative social network analysis, visualization of link

A-list blogs are overrepresented and central in the

densely interconnected. At the same time, a majority of

Slashdot is a news and discussion site that has used comment rating to allow massive participation while providing a mechanism for users to filter content.

Of users who changed the defaults, more than three times as many chose to use ratings for filtering or sorting as chose to suppress the use of comment ratings. Nearly half of registered users, however, never strayed from the default filtering settings, suggesting that the costs of exploring and selecting custom filter settings exceeds the expected benefit for many users. We recommend leveraging the efforts of the users that actively choose filter settings to reduce the cost of changing settings for all other users. One strategy is to create static schemas that capture the filtering preferences of different groups of readers. Another strategy is to dynamically set filtering thresholds for each conversation thread, based in part on the choices of previous readers. For predicting later readers' choices, the choices of previous readers are far more useful than content features such as the number of comments or the ratings of those comments.}

  author={Halavais, Alexander M Campbell},
  year={2001},
  abstract = {Slashdot bills itself as the source of "News for Nerds. Stuff that Matters." The site itself is a collective "web log" ( blog), a way of concentrating news and other information from the web and commenting upon it. In addition, reviews and other original materials are presented. In some respects, it bears a considerable resemblance to traditional print and on-line newspapers, but with a heavier reliance on contributed and found stories, and a greatly expanded section of letters to the editor.This dissertation argues that Slashdot emerged from collaboration among a group that shares a cultural commitment to open discussion. This combination---the dedication to open discussion with the technology to facilitate mass interaction---allows Slashdot to perform the larger function of linking social groups, voices, and ideas that would otherwise remain separated. It is a force that acts against what has been called the "balkanization" of the world wide web, the formation of tight-knit hyperlinked clusters of web site in which the range of topics and viewpoints is fairly narrow. Slashdot is not perfect in this regard, by any means. Its users employ their own exclusionary practices, especially toward newcomers, and many remain uninterested in the technological discussions that take place there. Despite this, the number of those who read and participate on Slashdot has continued to grow exponentially over the last three years. More than most web sites, Slashdot exploits the connective structures of hypertext to unite disparate ideas, bringing them to a much wider audience than they would otherwise enjoy.Slashdot represents an early example of a "virtual public." By encouraging mass interaction and large-scale conversations, it falls somewhere between traditional explorations of organizational communication and larger-scale mass media systems. It is in some ways a distinctive application of computer networking. The exploration of the site presented here takes several forms. The culture of open source and computer professionals generally is discussed, examples of the discussions on Slashdot are analyzed, the context of Slashdot within the larger hyperlinked web is presented, and through two example cases, the interface between Slashdot and the traditional press is explored.}

responses from posters and lurkers from 375 MSN bulletin board communities, 219 lurkers spoke
out about their reasons for not posting. While lurkers did not participate publicly, they did seek
answers to questions. However, lurkers’ satisfaction with their community experience was lower
than those who post. Data from 19 checkbox items and over 490 open-ended responses were
analyzed. From this analysis, the main reasons why lurkers lurk were concerned with: not needing
to post; needing to find out more about the group before participating; thinking that they were
being helpful by not posting; not being able to make the software work (i.e., poor usability); and
not liking the group dynamics or the community was a poor fit for them. Two key conclusions
were drawn from this analysis. First, there are many reasons why people lurk in online discussion
communities. Second, and most important, most lurkers are not selfish free-riders. From these
findings, it is clear that there are many ways to improve online community experiences for both

  booktitle={Proceedings of the 2013 conference on Computer supported cooperative work},
  pages={1487--1498},
  year={2013},
  organization={ACM},
  abstract = {This paper discusses three concepts that govern technosocial
practices among university students with iPhones. First is the
social expectation of constant connection that requires
multitasking to achieve. Second is the resulting technosocial
pecking order of who gets interrupted or ignored for whom.
Third is the way that many students push back against these
demands with techno-resistance, deliberately curtailing
constant connection to reduce the negative effects of
multitasking, in spite of the risk of social censure. These
concepts are developed from interviews with 57 students, 30
hours of field observations, and a survey of 177 students on
Stanford campus, which in particular explored iPhone use.
This research concludes that so-called “digital natives” must
still navigate familiar social dynamics and personal desires,
both online and off. Providing a detailed description of how
students from across campus make sense of iPhones in their
everyday technosocial assemblages, this research suggests
opportunities for more socially and cognitively sensitive
design of smartphone features. }

online. Pejorative terms such as ‘lurking’ have failed to capture much detail about the
experience of presence online. Instead, much online media research has focused on
‘having a voice’, be it in blogs, wikis, social media, or discussion lists. The metaphor
of listening can offer a productive way to analyse the forms of online engagement that
have previously been overlooked, while also allowing a deeper consideration of the
emerging disciplines of online attention. Social media are the focus of this paper, and
in particular, how these platforms are changing the configurations of the ideal
listening subject. Three modes of online listening are discussed: background listening,
reciprocal listening, and delegated listening; Twitter provides a case study for
how these modes are experienced and performed by individuals, politicians and
corporations.}

  abstract = {This paper is a study of consumer resistance among active abstainers of the Facebook
social network site. I analyze the discourses invoked by individuals who consciously
choose to abstain from participation on the ubiquitous Facebook platform. This
discourse analysis draws from approximately 100 web and print publications from 2006
to early 2012, as well as personal interviews conducted with 20 Facebook abstainers. I
conceptualize Facebook abstention as a performative mode of resistance, which must
be understood within the context of a neoliberal consumer culture, in which subjects
are empowered to act through consumption choices – or in this case non-consumption
choices – and through the public display of those choices. I argue that such public displays
are always at risk of misinterpretation due to the dominant discursive frameworks
through which abstention is given meaning. This paper gives particular attention to the
ways in which connotations of taste and distinction are invoked by refusers through
their conspicuous displays of non-consumption. This has the effect of framing refusal as
a performance of elitism, which may work against observers interpreting conscientious
refusal as a persuasive and emulable practice of critique. The implication of this is that
refusal is a limited tactic of political engagement where media platforms are concerned.}

regarding the impact it has on sociality. However, as Facebook is a very recent social phenomenon,
there is a distinct lack of psychological theory relating to its use. While research has begun to identify the
types of people who use Facebook, this line of investigation has been limited to student populations. The
current study aimed to investigate how personality influences usage or non-usage of Facebook. The sample
consisted of 1324 self-selected Australian Internet users (1158 Facebook users and 166 Facebook nonusers),
between the ages of 18 and 44. Participants were required to complete an online questionnaire
package comprising the Big Five Inventory (BFI), the Narcissistic Personality Inventory – 29-item version
(NPI-29), the Revised Cheek and Buss Shyness Scale (RCBS), and the Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale
for Adults – Short version (SELSA-S). Facebook users also completed a Facebook usage questionnaire. The
results showed that Facebook users tend to be more extraverted and narcissistic, but less conscientious
and socially lonely, than nonusers. Furthermore, frequency of Facebook use and preferences for specific
features were also shown to vary as a result of certain characteristics, such as neuroticism, loneliness,
shyness and narcissism. It is hoped that research in this area continues, and leads to the development
of theory regarding the implications and gratifications of Facebook use}

suggest that use of such sites is not randomly distributed across a group of highly wired

all associated with use, but in most cases only when the aggregate concept of social network
sites is disaggregated by service. Additionally, people with more experience and
autonomy of use are more likely to be users of such sites. Unequal participation based
on user background suggests that differential adoption of such services may be contributing
to digital inequality.}

It proposes an SNS acceptance model by integrating cognitive as well as affective attitudes as primary influencing factors, which are driven by underlying beliefs, perceived security, perceived privacy, trust, attitude, and intention. Results from a survey of SNS users validate that the proposed theoretical model explains and predicts user acceptance of SNS substantially well. The model shows excellent measurement properties and establishes perceived privacy and perceived security of SNS as distinct constructs. The finding also reveals that perceived security moderates the effect of perceived privacy on trust. Based on the results of this study, practical implications for marketing strategies in SNS markets and theoretical implications are recommended accordingly.}

the decision-making failure that leads to ill-fated

intuition for CSCW applications. 3) A factor contributing
to the failure to learn from experience is the extreme
difficulty of evaluating these applications. These three

Third, a series of qualitative member checking interviews with additional survey respondents served to validate the findings of the follow-up survey.

of reversion: simple quantitative predictors of reversion, factor analysis of adjectives used by respondents to describe their
experiences of not using Facebook, and statistical topic analysis of free-text responses. Significant factors predicting either
increased or decreased likelihood of reversion include, among others, prior use of Facebook, experiences associated with
perceived addiction, issues of social boundary negotiation such as privacy and surveillance, use of other social media, and
friends’ reactions to non-use. These findings contribute to the growing literature on technology non-use by demonstrating
how social media users negotiate, both with each other and with themselves, among types and degrees of use and non-use.}

The study group (n=20) consisted of 18 to 25yearold undergraduate students, who were selected by the purposive sampling method. Data were collected from two large state universities in Turkey. Facebook, as one of the most popular social networking websites, was selected as a study context. Qualitative research methods were used in the data collection and analysis processes. The primary reasons for not using social networking websites were that they were perceived to be a waste of time, or an unnecessary tool; that they might lead to an addiction; that they might violate privacy concerns or share unnecessary information; and that they might invoke family concerns. Additionally, the findings indicated that most of the students did not trust virtual friendships, and did not like sharing photographs and political views online. This identification of non-user students’ attitudes about SNSs will help us to better understand individual perceptions and experiences relating to these social services.}

Although questions relating to how individuals use SNSs such as Facebook for social purposes have been examined, less research has investigated why people may decide to abstain from SNS use. The present study extends existing work into technology non-use, personality, and online communication attitudes to better understand the predictors of Facebook abstention. A diverse sample was recruited to complete an online survey in which participants reported on their shyness, sociability, and sociotropy, as well as their attitudes towards online communication. Facebook non-users were less shy, but also less sociable and sociotropic than their Facebook using counterparts. In addition, attitudes towards online communication mediated the relationship between personality and Facebook non-use. Results and implications are framed using previous research into technology non-use.}

We observe hedging patterns (e.g. "I thought about giving up Twitter for Lent but"?) that surfaced uncertainty about social media behavior. Interview participants were concerned about the tradeoffs of spending time on social media versus doing other things and of spending time on social media rather than in "real life." We discuss gaps in related theory that might help reduce users' anxieties and open design problems related to designing systems and services that can help users manage their own social media use.}

In view of this, a new policy approach is proposed to increase ICT acceptance. The approach is based on strategies of segmentation and differentiation. This entails that policy initiatives are specifically targeted towards different groups in the population. This article demonstrates that being a non-user can be explained by a combination of access problems, lack of ICT skills or rather negative attitudes towards ICT or by the outweighing effect of one of them.

In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a unified model that integrates elements across the eight models, and (4) empirically validate the unified model. The eight models reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model, the motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, the model of PC utilization, the innovation diffusion theory, and the social cognitive theory. Using data from four organizations over a six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user intentions to use information technology. Next, a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships. UTAUT was then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight individual models (adjusted R of 69 percent). UTAUT was then confirmed with data from two new organizations with similar results (adjusted R of 70 percent). UTAUT thus provides a useful tool for managers needing to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to proactively design interventions (including training, marketing, etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to adopt and use new systems. The paper also makes several recommendations for future research including developing a deeper understanding of the dynamic influences studied here, refining measurement of the core constructs used in UTAUT, and understanding the organizational outcomes associated with new technology use.}

Most subjective measures used in practice are

ease of use, which are hypothesized to
be fundamental determinants of user acceptance.
Definitions for these two variables were
used to develop scale items that were pretested
for content validity and then tested for reliability
and construct validity in two studies involving
a total of 152 users and four application programs.
The measures were refined and streamlined,
resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities
of .98 for usefulness and .94 for ease
of use. The scales exhibited high convergent,
discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness
was significantly correlated with both selfreported
current usage (r=.63, Study 1) and
self-predicted future usage (r= .85, Study 2). Perceived
ease of use was also significantly correlated
with current usage (r=.45, Study 1) and
future usage (r=.59, Study 2). In both studies,
usefulness had a significantly greater correlation
with usage behavior than did ease of use.
Regression analyses suggest that perceived
ease of use may actually be a causal antecedent to perceived usefulness, as opposed to
a parallel, direct determinant of system usage.
Implications are drawn for future research on
user acceptance.}

Findings show that personality traits predicted concern for secondary goals (N = 477) and that secondary goals predicted the use of various self-presentation tactics used on Facebook.

  abstract = {To better explain resistance to information technology
implementation, we used a multilevel, longitudinal
approach. We first assessed extant
models of resistance to IT. Using semantic analysis,
we identified five basic components of resistance:
behaviors, object, subject, threats, and
initial conditions. We further examined extant
models to (1) carry out a preliminary specification of the nature of the relationships between these
components and (2) refine our understanding of
the multilevel nature of the phenomenon. Using
analytic induction, we examined data from three
case studies of clinical information systems implementations
in hospital settings, focusing on physicians’
resistance behaviors. The resulting mixeddeterminants
model suggests that group resistance
behaviors vary during implementation.
When a system is introduced, users in a group will
first assess it in terms of the interplay between its
features and individual and/or organizational-level
initial conditions. They then make projections
about the consequences of its use. If expected
consequences are threatening, resistance behaviors
will result. During implementation, should
some trigger occur to either modify or activate an
initial condition involving the balance of power
between the group and other user groups, it will
also modify the object of resistance, from system
to system significance. If the relevant initial
conditions pertain to the power of the resisting
group vis-à-vis the system advocates, the object of
resistance will also be modified, from system
significance to system advocates. Resistance
behaviors will follow if threats are perceived from
the interaction between the object of resistance
and initial conditions. We also found that the
bottom-up process by which group resistance
behaviors emerge from individual behaviors is not
the same in early versus late implementation. In early implementation, the emergence process is
one of compilation, described as a combination of
independent, individual behaviors. In later stages
of implementation, if group level initial conditions
have become active, the emergence process is
one of composition, described as the convergence
of individual behaviors.}

  abstract = {User resistance to information systems implementation has
been identified as a salient reason for the failure of new systems

previous research has explored the reasons for user resistance,
there are gaps in our understanding of how users
evaluate change related to a new information system and
decide to resist it. In particular, missing in the explanation of
user decision making is the concept of status quo bias, that is,
that user resistance can be due to the bias or preference to stay with the current situation. Motivated thus, this study
develops a model to explain user resistance prior to a new IS
implementation by integrating the technology acceptance and
resistance literatures with the status quo bias perspective.
The results of testing the model in the context of a new enterprise
system implementation indicate the central role of
switching costs in increasing user resistance. Further,
switching costs also mediate the relationship between other
antecedents (colleague opinion and self-efficacy for change)
and user resistance. Additionally, perceived value and
organizational support for change are found to reduce user
resistance. This research advances the theoretical understanding
of user acceptance and resistance prior to a new IS
implementation and offers organizations suggestions for
managing such resistance.}

This perspective assumes that any resistance manifesting itself in a covert manner is generally dysfunctional and is motivated more by either criminal intent or opportunities for personal gain.

The purpose of this paper is to focus attention on a form of covert resistance to the IT implementation process that is neither couched in criminal intent nor motivated by personal gain. We define passive resistance misuse (PRM) to be a recalcitrant, covert behaviour that results from both fear and stress stemming from the intrusion of the technology into the previously stable world of the user. Such behaviour takes the form of overt cooperation and acceptance of the proposed system combined with covert resistance and likely sabotage of the implementation effort. We offer two related theoretical foundations to assist in explaining the phenomenon of PRM: (1) passive-aggressive behaviour theory and (2) action science's espoused theories vs theories in use. Through these two theoretical lenses we describe PRM, provide examples of PRM behaviour as well as its proposed causes and offer a framework for inclusion of this construct into an information system (IS) design and implementation research agenda.}

The purpose of this study was to evaluate college students' Facebook disclosures that met DSM criteria for a depression symptom or a major depressive episode (MDE). Methods: We selected public Facebook profiles from sophomore and junior undergraduates and evaluated personally written text: “status updates.” We applied DSM criteria to 1‐year status updates from each profile to determine prevalence of displayed depression symptoms and MDE criteria. Negative binomial regression analysis was used to model the association between depression disclosures and demographics or Facebook use characteristics. Results: Two hundred profiles were evaluated, and profile owners were 43.5\% female with a mean age of 20 years. Overall, 25\% of profiles displayed depressive symptoms and 2.5\% met criteria for MDE. Profile owners were more likely to reference depression, if they averaged at least one online response from their friends to a status update disclosing depressive symptoms (exp(B) = 2.1, P<.001), or if they used Facebook more frequently (P<.001). Conclusion: College students commonly display symptoms consistent with depression on Facebook. Our findings suggest that those who receive online reinforcement from their friends are more likely to discuss their depressive symptoms publicly on Facebook. Given the frequency of depression symptom displays on public profiles, social networking sites could be an innovative avenue for combating stigma surrounding mental health conditions or for identifying students at risk for depression.}

All the most current data on teens is drawn from a survey the authors conducted between June 26 and September 24, 2009 of 800 adolescents between ages 12 and 17. Most of the adult data are drawn from a survey they conducted between August 18 and September 14, 2009 of 2,253 adults (age 18 and over). (Contains 2 tables and 13 footnotes.)}

it really works. Prior literature diverges on how people’s Internet
knowledge affects their privacy and security decisions. We
undertook a qualitative study to understand what people do and do
not know about the Internet and how that knowledge affects their
responses to privacy and security risks. Lay people, as compared
to those with computer science or related backgrounds, had
simpler mental models that omitted Internet levels, organizations,
and entities. People with more articulated technical models
perceived more privacy threats, possibly driven by their more
accurate understanding of where specific risks could occur in the
network. Despite these differences, we did not find a direct
relationship between people’s technical background and the
actions they took to control their privacy or increase their security
online. Consistent with other work on user knowledge and
experience, our study suggests a greater emphasis on policies and
systems that protect privacy and}

  abstract = {As Social Network Sites (SNS) permeate our daily routines, the question whether
participation results in value for SNS users becomes particularly acute. This study
adopts a 'participation-source-outcome' perspective to explore how distinct uses of SNS
generate various types of social capital benefits. Building on existing research, extensive
qualitative findings and an empirical study with 253 Facebook users, we uncover the
process of social capital formation on SNS. We find that even though active
communication is an important prerequisite, it is the diversified network structure and
the increased social connectedness that are responsible for the attainment of the four
benefits of social capital on SNS: emotional support, networking value, horizon
broadening and offline participation. Moreover, we propose and validate scales to
measure social capital benefits in the novel context of SNS.}

  volume={9},
  pages={20},
  year={2015},
  abstract = {As social network sites grow and diversify in both users and content, tensions between
users’ audience composition and their disclosure practices become more prevalent.
Users must navigate these spaces carefully to reap relational benefits while ensuring
content is not shared with unintended audiences. Through a qualitative study of highly
engaged Facebook users, this study provides insight into how people conceptualize
friendship online as well as how perceived audience affects privacy concerns and privacy
management strategies. Findings suggest an increasingly complex relationship between
these variables, fueled by collapsing contexts and invisible audiences. Although a diverse
range of strategies are available to manage privacy, most participants in this sample still
engaged in some degree of self-censorship.}
