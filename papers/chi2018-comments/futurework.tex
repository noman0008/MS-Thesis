\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:futurework}

Our findings engender interesting potential research questions: Do we get similar user sentiments towards other non-Facebook privacy sensitive media? Does incorporating more data and application of machine learning based text classification approach guarantee successful prediction? For our future work we want to explore other sources where users discuss their Facebook user experience to get a comprehensive understanding. This however, is not feasible to answer in a single paper, since everyday more and more such platforms are emerging and also analysis of a particular site provides answers to problems of specific audience. Design and implementation of a text classifier, which will significantly reduce the human effort and increase data for further training, is also left as future work. Also, we would like to extend the knowledge gathered from this study to address more generic agenda, such as overall social media (not only Facebook) sentiment mining. We want to use more hand annotated data for future analysis as it will not only increase the accuracy but also help getting our domain specific sentiment.
