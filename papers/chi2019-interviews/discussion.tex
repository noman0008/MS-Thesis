%Ultimately, we could find some common traits between our users. Facebook's ease and convenience of connecting people is a commonly acknowledged trait between our users, which we expected since this falls in line with why Facebook is such a popular site, to begin with. 7 out of 8 users also said their frequency of posts from their account had decreased over time since they created their accounts. This also falls in line with other literature about Facebook usage since it is commonly observed that original posting has decreased on Facebook in recent years. With 3 users mentioning that they are currently thinking of leaving the platform, there is a noticeable trend of users thinking of abandoning the platform. Our participants mentioned that they wouldn't leave the platform due to the connections that are maintained on Facebook, and the fear of losing contact with some of these friends or family members. 
%There were also quite a few outliers or special insights that only one participant may have mentioned, but are still important factors or insights to consider. P8 mentioned specifically that the participant did not like the fact that the parents are on Facebook. P7 had multiple Facebook accounts, and the most out of any of our participants with 3 Facebook, 2 Twitter, and 5 Reddit accounts. P6 showed strong dissatisfaction about the Facebook account reactivating after 7 days, whereas earlier it would stay deactivated unless you logged back in. 
%Add the typology

%non-use typology: feature based (users use Facebook only for particular features and abandon the rest), people based (Use Facebook to connect with a particular subset of their friend-list instead of connecting with everyone), time based (users use Facebook depending on one's availability, such as while travelling, or during ideal time and ignore the rest of the time), privacy/ideology based (users use in ways that preserve privacy..e.g. via passive consumption or self censorship), tool based (e.g., Adblock, encryption methods of messenger), and highlight based (users post only about the highlights of their life and avoid posting mundane activities or what's in their mind).
