\begin{abstract}
As technology permeates every facet of everyday life, increasing attention is being paid to its potential negative effects. Limited use is a strategy that attempts to counter some of these downsides. Via interviews with individuals who indicated reduced use of Facebook, we describe the variety of ways in which use limiting may be practiced. Our findings lead to a framework for understanding, and designing for, selective engagement. We argue that supporting selective engagement has the potential for improving user satisfaction and well being and reducing privacy violations and concerns.
