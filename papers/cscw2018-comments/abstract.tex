Owing to its exponential rise in popularity and adoption, social media usage has received extensive research attention in the past decade. Recently, however, researchers have started to recognize the need to pay attention to negative aspects and non-use of social media in order to uncover barriers and surface shortcomings of these systems. We contribute to these efforts by analyzing user-generated comments on posts related to Facebook on blogs with a tech savvy readership. We found that nearly half of total 3000 randomly selected reader comments indicated negative sentiment and described implied or explicit non-adoption. Our findings highlight the importance of utilizing user generated content as a tool for large scale user feedback. Moreover, we highlight that expert perspectives can aid in early surfacing of problematic aspects.
