%Ultimately, we could find some common traits between our users. Facebook's ease and convenience of connecting people is a commonly acknowledged trait between our users, which we expected since this falls in line with why Facebook is such a popular site, to begin with. 7 out of 8 users also said their frequency of posts from their account had decreased over time since they created their accounts. This also falls in line with other literature about Facebook usage since it is commonly observed that original posting has decreased on Facebook in recent years. With 3 users mentioning that they are currently thinking of leaving the site, there is a noticeable trend of users thinking of abandoning the site. Our participants mentioned that they wouldn't leave the site due to the connections that are maintained on Facebook, and the fear of losing contact with some of these friends or family members. 
%There were also quite a few outliers or special insights that only one participant may have mentioned, but are still important factors or insights to consider. P8 mentioned specifically that the participant did not like the fact that the parents are on Facebook. P7 had multiple Facebook accounts, and the most out of any of our participants with 3 Facebook, 2 Twitter, and 5 Reddit accounts. P6 showed strong dissatisfaction about the Facebook account reactivating after 7 days, whereas earlier it would stay deactivated unless you logged back in.
